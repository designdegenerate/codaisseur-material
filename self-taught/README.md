# Self prep
In order to prepare for the course, I also did some of these projects on my own initiative. All written in vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS.

## Book Tracker
- A small webapp to track the books youâ€™ve read. Uses localstorage.

## Credit Card Form
- A form with front-end HTML validation.

## Forms Practice
- Exactly what it says.

## Login Page
- A non-functioning login page with Flex(box) based styling.

## Tables
- A little practice with old-school HTML tables.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
- A Tic-Tac-Toe game in vanilla JS.

## Functions.js
- a little practice with functions, factory constructors, etc.
