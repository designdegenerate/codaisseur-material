# Codaisseur Course Material
This contains (almost) all of my code developed as part of the full stack bootcamp of [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/). The only missing material are the assessments (in which publication is forbidden,) and my [INSERT HERE](), which acts as the final portfolio piece of my time at Codaisseur.

While many students have this content spread across many repos, I felt it nicer and cleaner to squash everything into one, because Github has no concept of grouped projects.

Due to this, it’s also very ugly code. For the sake of the bootcamp, learning and *“done is better than perfect”* (in that order) was prioritized over clean code.
