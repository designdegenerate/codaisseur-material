# Codaisseur Course Material
This contains (almost) all of my code developed as part of the full stack bootcamp of [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/). The only missing material are the assessments, as publication is forbidden. My portfolio piece is also absent and [availabel here]() instead.

While many students have this content spread across many repos, I felt it nicer and cleaner to squash everything into one, because Github has no concept of grouped projects.

Due to this, it’s also very ugly code. For the sake of the bootcamp, learning and *“done is better than perfect”* (in that order) was prioritized over clean code.

For more information on each project or section, read its enclosed ``README.md`` file.
