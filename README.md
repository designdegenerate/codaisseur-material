# Codaisseur Course Material
This contains (almost) all of my code developed as part of the full stack bootcamp of [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/). The only missing material are the assessments, as publication is forbidden. 

While many students have this content spread across many repos, I felt it nicer and cleaner to squash everything into one, because Github has no concept of grouped projects.

Due to this, itâ€™s also very ugly code. For the sake of the bootcamp, learning was prioritized over clean code. All of it can be refactored to be a lot better

For more information on each project or section, read its enclosed ``README.md`` file.
