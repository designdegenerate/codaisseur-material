# BMI Calculator

A basic and overly-simplified BMI (mody mass index) calculator. Runs in the terminal as a node script. Not particularly accurate at all. 

## Basic script
The ``basic`` script requires 3 arguments:
age, height (in meters), and weight (in kg).

Example:
``$ node basic.js 22 160 50``

## Advanced Script
The ``advanced`` and ``refactored`` script require 5 arguments to run: weight (in kg), height (in meters), age, daily exercise (yes or no), and sex (m/f).

``$ node index.js 82 1.79 32 yes m``

## System Requirements
Requires Node.
